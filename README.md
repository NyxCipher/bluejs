# The H4cktivate Mindset Project
This project was created using [BlueprintJS](https://blueprintjs.com).
This project is based in ReactJS

# About Project H.M.
Professionally, I work in DevOps, specifically IT-Operations. Little development is expected of me here, that is why I like to suprise people with hidden NodeJS and Python Knowledge, even some MINGW Cross-Compiling C++ knowledge as well. But this knowledge is seated in my drive to learn InfoSec, Security, and Penetration Testing. The goal and purpose of H.M. is to seat my knowledge for you and to grow it accordingly by freely teaching and giving to you what was once given freely to me.

### Segments:
You will find various segments on the site. 
* The Vault Segment: Is a series of Key-Books and Periodicals that have helped me learn and that are helping me learn throughout the years. 
* The Lounge Segment: will house a series of TEXT-Based-Tutorials on InfoSec//Security. 
* The Files Segment:  I hold close to me. A couple a friends and I share a massive archive of Bookmarks and data-points on relevant IT and CyberSecurity Key Areas of interest. Those will be houses here.

# About Development
I started this project to explore the changes in React & TypeScript from over the past two years.

After searching for the top React UI Frameworks, and having found nearly 30 different types,
I setteled on three main ones: MaterialKitUI, AntJS, and BluePrintJS. I truly loved BlueprintJS the most, but setteled on MaterialKitUI for its ease of use. Having become unsetteled with how little React was used in the free version, I started reading some Tutorials and ultimately switched to BlueprintJS. The challenge has been a welcoming one and I am enjoying pushing my boundries in learning how to configure the various aspects of BlueprintJS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
